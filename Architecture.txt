API (Application Programming Interface)
=======================================
Defines the API endpoints.
Checks the incoming commands/queries for validity.
Passes valid commands/queries to appropriate handlers.
Returns good API responses or a consistently formatted error response if failures detected.


BLL (Business Logic Layer)
==========================
Services:
---------
Services accept an injected repository (if operation is limited to a single repository) or a UoW
(if several repositories are affected).
Services are the only entity that can call .SaveChanges()


DAL (Data Access Layer)
=======================
This level may be swapped out for any other database type and work exactly the same. The database type
needs only to implement the TBA interfaces.
This deals exclusively with Entity Framework command on the injected ApplicationDbContext.
It does not call SaveChanges() on any Commands. This is done at the service level.

Infrastructure
==============
Deals with calls to the infrastructure such as Date/Time 

Interfaces are defined in the Domain/Core projects ONLY. No interfaces should appear in any other
layer; only the implementations of those interfaces.
